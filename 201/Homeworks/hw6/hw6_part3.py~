#    Calculates the summation of a number, stopping at a specified number

###########################################################################
# summ()  performs the summation of one number down to another number
# Input:  sumFrom; a number to do the summation from
#         sumTo; a number to do the summation to
# Output: summation; the summation of the first number o the second number

        return summ(sumFrom - 1 , sumTo) + sumFrom
